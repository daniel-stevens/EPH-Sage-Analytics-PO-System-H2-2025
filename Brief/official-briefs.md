Purchase Order System
Our current purchase-order (PO) process sits entirely inside Sage Line 50. We now need a PO solution that integrates with Zoho CRM so we can track costs and goods-in and link every PO to our work-ticket, estimating, supplier, product, and bill-of-materials data. The new system must synchronise with Sage Line 50 in real time—or at minimum once per day—because supplier payments and all expense recording will continue to happen in Sage.
To deliver this, you will:
•	Map the full Sage PO data model, field by field, and design the link-points into Zoho CRM.
•	Work around Sage’s limited APIs and custom-field options, or—if analysis shows clear benefit—recommend an alternative Sage platform that offers tighter, two-way integration.
•	Fold our separate requisition-request and purchasing tool into the new PO workflow.
•	Expand CRM modules for bills of materials, inventory, and stock ordering as part of the roll-out.

Accounting Data
Sage Line 50 remains the single source of truth for all financial information, but we need its data—sales invoices, credit notes, and any purchases that bypass the external PO system—to surface alongside CRM data for costing and KPI reporting. Several finance workflows (expenses, company credit cards, credit-control actions, third-party costs) also need structured processes and approvals rather than ad-hoc spreadsheets.
Your brief is to build more than a read-only export. Engineer a data pipeline that:
•	Accesses and writes back where necessary, while preserving Sage reconciliation integrity.
•	Auto-reconciles transactions to projects, departments, systems, people, and processes through multiple look-ups—auto-allocating wherever rules allow and keeping manual touch-time lean.
•	Introduces staged releases, agreed with Finance and the Managing Director, so value lands early while the full roadmap unfolds.
Deep knowledge of Sage Line 50’s schema and close collaboration with Finance and the MD will be essential to set the phasing, strategy, and priorities.
