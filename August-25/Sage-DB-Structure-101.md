# Age & Origins of Sage 50 (Line 50)
Line 50 is decades old — it started life in the 1980s as a DOS product, then Windows, and much of its architecture still reflects that era.
It evolved from single-user, flat-file systems into a multi-user desktop product.
The “database” wasn’t initially designed for third-party integration; it was an internal persistence layer.

# Sage Line 50 - Underlying Storage/Data Model
- UK Sage 50 uses a proprietary ISAM/Flat file database (often accessed through ODBC or Sage Data Objects), not a modern relational engine like SQL Server or Postgres.
- Relationships exist logically, but there are no formal foreign keys in the files — linking is done by agreed column names (e.g., ACCOUNT_REF), not enforced constraints.
- That means an ERD is conceptual rather than a true relational model.


# Product Position & Market
Line 50 was aimed at SMEs, where deep API or schema-level integration was not the core selling point.

Sage provided reporting tools and later limited APIs, but didn’t encourage direct table access — the official stance is still “use the Sage ODBC driver or Sage Data Objects” rather than query files directly.

# Version Variability
Table sets differ between:
UK vs. US/Canadian editions
Standard vs. Professional
Modules enabled (Stock, Projects, CIS, BOMs, Foreign Currency, etc.)
Publishing a “one-size-fits-all” ERD would invite confusion because many customers wouldn’t see half the tables.

Dev Q's:
- Which version of sage are we using?
Standard or Professional?
- Which modules are we using?

# Commercial & Support Concerns
Sage doesn’t want customers directly editing the underlying data — corruption risk is high if constraints aren’t respected.
An official ERD would make it easier to bypass Sage’s APIs, which could increase support incidents (“unsupported changes”).
Intacct, by contrast, is built as an API-first SaaS product — publishing an ERD is part of its integration marketing.
