Can I update my Sage Accounts data using the ODBC driver?
The ODBC driver is read-only, allowing you to retrieve data from Sage Accounts into other software, but you cannot update information back into Sage Accounts.

This is perfect for initial development and pulling data out, but for next phase of development the SDK or third party API must be used to push data back in.
